description: Create git commits with no Claude attribution. NEVER adds co-author information—commits appear as if user wrote them. Use when user asks to "commit", "make a commit", save work to git, says "wrap up" or "finish" after completing work, asks "what's next?" or "are we done?" after coding, or mentions staging changes or commit messages.

# Commit Changes

Create clean, professional git commits that appear as if the user wrote them directly. No AI attribution, no co-author tags, no "generated by" messages.

## Process

### 1. Assess Changes
- Review the entire conversation context to understand the full scope of work done
- Run `git status` to see all modified, added, and deleted files
- Run `git diff` (and `git diff --staged` if applicable) to see actual changes
- Determine if changes should be grouped into one commit or split into multiple logical commits
- Consider the semantic relationship between changes (related features, fixes, refactors)

### 2. Plan Commits
- Group related files logically by feature, fix, or refactor
- Draft commit messages in imperative mood (e.g., "Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Focus messages on *why* the change matters, not just *what* changed
- Keep commits atomic and focused on a single logical change
- If multiple unrelated changes exist, plan separate commits for each
- Follow conventional commit format if the project uses it (check recent git log)

### 3. Execute Commits
- Use `git add` with specific file paths (NEVER use `-A`, `.`, or `--all`)
- Create each commit with the planned message
- After all commits, show results with `git log --oneline -n [number]`
- Confirm completion: "Created [N] commit(s)"

## Critical Rules

**Attribution Rules (NEVER VIOLATE THESE):**
- NO co-author information of any kind
- NO "Generated with Claude" or similar messages
- NO "Co-Authored-By" lines
- NO AI attribution in commit messages or metadata
- Write messages as if the user wrote them directly

**Commit Quality Rules:**
- Always use specific file paths with `git add`, never wildcards or "add all"
- Imperative mood for commit messages (e.g., "Fix bug" not "Fixed bug")
- Focus on why, not just what (e.g., "Fix race condition in auth" not "Update auth.py")
- Keep commits atomic - one logical change per commit
- Review conversation context fully before planning commits

**Execution Rules:**
- Execute commits immediately without asking for permission
- Briefly inform the user what commits were created after completion
- Split unrelated changes into multiple atomic commits automatically
- Use best judgment for commit organization based on change context

## Sub-Agent Recommendations

This skill does NOT require sub-agents. Execute directly because:
- Commits require conversation context that sub-agents don't have access to
- Git operations are straightforward and don't require specialized reasoning
