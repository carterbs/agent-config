# agents-config

Claude Code marketplace for me. Syncs humanlayer commands. Will sync my own eventually, if I ever get around to defining them.

## What this repo does

- Defines a marketplace entry in `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`
- Points the marketplace at `./plugins` as the plugin root
- Ships one plugin: `brad-personal`
